I used my index.html as my home page, added a carousel with a nav bar that lets you access the following links:

Bio.html, included an image followed by a header, my official bio, and the TMO logo.

career.html contains a table, as well as a un-order list of y education as well as my awards and decorations

travels.html i took advantage of the bootstrap component card; all images are linked to the Visit site for the corresponding country or state.

contact.html contains a simple youtube video.

all .html's have the nav bar that lets you access any portion of my site. they also use the grid system used by bootstrap. and finally they all contain a footer.
